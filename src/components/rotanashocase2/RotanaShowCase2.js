                  All our cars are provided with comprehensive insurance. This
                  means that by default, you are covered incase of an accidental
                  damage provided it isn’t your fault. A police report must be
                  obtained at the time of an accident. Your rental amount
                  includes this coverage. We can also provide CDW (collision
                  damage waiver) for an additional charge. This covers you for
                  any accidental damage by your own fault as well. However, a
                  valid police report is still required for coverage.

                When you’re in the shopping and business capital of the Middle
                East, you should make the best of your time here by renting a
                car. Renting a car is a top priority that will make your travel
                in the city much more practical.
              </p>
              <p>
                You do not want to deal with the hassle of purchasing a vehicle,
                handling its registration process, insurance and maintenance.
                It’s a headache to own a car in Dubai when you can easily rent.
              </p>
              <p>
                For business or pleasure, for short or long term, renting a car
                for your stay in Dubai has many benefits. If you’re visiting
                from another country or you’re a local, car rentals offer
                amazing discounts and great vehicles for any budget. No matter
                what type of car you desire, it’s always worth renting in Dubai
                to go around the city as well as travel long distance across the
                Emirates through the beautiful desert landscapes.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also makes your stay practical since public transportation is
                not available in all parts of the city. Whether you are looking
                for a luxury car like the Lamborghini, an elegant car like the
                Rolls Royce, or a budget car like the Toyota, you will find a
                big choice of options to satisfy your desire and your every
                mood.
