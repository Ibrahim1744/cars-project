          <h1>About Dubai</h1>
          <p>
            Who doesn’t know Dubai? The hub of beauty, luxury, and glamor, Dubai
            is one of the most recognized tour destinations in the world. With
            Burj Khalifa, Burj Al Arab, Dubai Mall, and Dubai Fountain, as its
            top attractions the regions is attracting over 15 million tourists
            every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, Dubai grew from a dessert fishing village to a
            cultural melting pot with unlimited leisure, business, and work
            opportunities. It’s hard to imagine that in 1968 there were only 13
            cars registered in the Emirate while nowadays almost 3 million cars
            move across the UAE every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many visitors, Dubai is their “American dream”. A vibrant
            lifestyle mixed with local culture, endless opportunities, and
            world-class shopping facilities makes Dubai and the UAE home for
            foreigners from all over the world. Dubai is a place of wonders
            where you can enjoy skiing on the real snow and the next minute you
            are already riding sand dunes, where you can walk among skyscrapers
            and in one turn find yourself in the old part of the city where
            everything is breathing with history and heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a fact that it’s impossible to explore Dubai in one trip,
            that’s why many visitors come over and over again to find hidden
            gems and explore the city. With Rotana Star, your trip will be full
            of positive emotions, as our cars are a mixture of luxury, comfort,
            and speed. Whether behind the wheel or with our chauffeur service,
            we will make sure your experience is unforgettable.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, whether you need a limousine for a special event, a luxury car
            or big SUV to pick up family or guests, a comfortable 4×4 for a road
            trip, or an economical car for the everyday drive, Rotana Star is
            here to assist with any car rental needs.
